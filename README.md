Beta versions of calculation files for my math project 'index'.

This is the pilot project of Index, a little program (which is to be created in the near future) for computing several calculation tasks in geodesy.
Surveying is a big area employing lots of different mathematical concepts, like trigonometric functions and Further Mathematics. Because of that,
automatising time-consuming calculations is the key to work more efficient and with the existence of tachymeters (electronic theodolites), this process has already been
made.
So, why am I making this stuff here although it already has been studied and implemented in practice?
My goal for myself is to understand the background of these calculations, how they function and where they derive from.
I am currently in vocational school and learning surveying and making these codes not only helps me understanding my calculating tasks better,
but also avail me increasing my coding knowledge in order to have a chance of working in computer science fields, which is my actual career goal.
Let's make some progress!
